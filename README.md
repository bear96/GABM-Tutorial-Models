# GABM-Tutorial-Models
Contains the code for the paper [Generative Agent-Based Modeling: Unveiling Social System Dynamics through Coupling Mechanistic Models with Generative Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11456).
The code can be run by downloading the different .ipynb files and either running them locally on Jupyter Notebooks/Anaconda, or uploading them to Google Colab and running them on cloud.
***It is recommended to use Google Colab to run Tutorial_for_GABM_with_multiprocessing because multiprocessing may not run on a Jupyter kernel, causing the machine to become unresponsive indefinitely***.
