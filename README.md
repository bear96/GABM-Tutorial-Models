# GABM-Tutorial-Models
Contains the code for the paper Generative Agent-Based Modeling: Unveiling Social System Dynamics through Coupling Mechanistic Models with Generative Artificial Intelligence
The code can be run by downloading the different .ipynb files and either running them locally on Jupyter Notebooks/Anaconda, or uploading them to Google Colab and running them on cloud.
It is recommended to use Google Colab to run [Tutorial_for_GABM_with_multiprocessing.ipynb](./Tutorial_for_GABM_with_multiprocessing.ipynb)
